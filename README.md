# Principal-Component-Analysis

Implement (in C++) a PCA algorithm [Lever et al., 2017], [Smith, 2002], to
find the covariance matrix and two (2) principal components of this data-set.
Results should answer the following questions:

1. What are the Eigenvalues for the principal components 1 and 2?
2. What are the Eigenvectors for the principal components 1 and 2 (showing
July and January component values for each)?
3. Compute the values for the covariance matrix.
4. What is the total variance?
5. What proportion (as a percentage) of total variance do principal compo-
nents 1 and 2 ”explain”?
